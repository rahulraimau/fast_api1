FastAPI Deployment – Video Narration Script

🎬 Slide 1: Introduction
Hi everyone! I’m Rahul Rai, and in this video, I’ll walk you through how to build and deploy a Machine Learning model using FastAPI.
We’ll train a simple classifier on the Iris dataset, serve it as an API, and deploy it using Docker and cloud platforms.

🧠 Slide 2: What is FastAPI?
FastAPI is a high-performance Python web framework specifically designed for APIs.
It supports asynchronous programming, automatic validation with Pydantic, and generates interactive documentation.
It’s lightweight and ideal for deploying machine learning models in production.

💡 Slide 3: Why FastAPI for AI Engineers?
AI engineers benefit from FastAPI because it lets you serve models with minimal code, automatic JSON handling, and type-checking.
It’s also fast, scalable, and supports tools like Docker for easy deployment.

⚙️ Slide 4: Deployment Workflow
Here’s the big picture:
Train and save the ML model
Create a FastAPI app with prediction endpoint
Test it locally
Deploy it using Docker to cloud platforms like Render, Heroku, or AWS.

📊 Slide 5: Train and Save the Model
This Python script trains a Logistic Regression model on the Iris dataset using scikit-learn and saves it as a .pkl file using pickle.
This saved model will be loaded later by our API for predictions.

🔧 Slide 6: FastAPI App Code
In our FastAPI app, we load the saved model, define an input schema using Pydantic, and create a /predict endpoint.
When we send a JSON with petal and sepal measurements, it returns the predicted species name.

🔍 Slide 7: Testing the API
Now let’s run the app using Uvicorn. Once it's running, we can visit /docs in the browser to test it via Swagger UI.
We enter the input values, hit “Execute”, and the app returns the predicted species like setosa or versicolor.

🐳 Slide 8: Dockerizing the App
To make our app portable and consistent, we use Docker.
The Dockerfile installs dependencies, exposes port 8000, and runs the FastAPI app with Uvicorn.
We then build the image and run it using docker build and docker run.

☁️ Slide 9: Deploy to Cloud
You can deploy this Docker container to cloud platforms like Render or Heroku.
Render is beginner-friendly — just connect your GitHub repo, define a startup command (uvicorn main:app), and it handles the rest.

☕ Slide 10: Real-World Analogy
Think of this as a coffee machine.
You give it an order — your flower measurements — and it returns coffee — the species.
FastAPI is the barista, Docker is the machine it runs on, and Render is the café that delivers it online.

✅ Slide 11: Summary
To summarize — FastAPI lets us deploy ML models quickly, with built-in validation, documentation, and async capabilities.
Combined with Docker and cloud deployment, it becomes a complete and scalable solution for real-world AI applications.

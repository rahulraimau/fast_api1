1.Model Selection: Use a simple ML model like the Iris classifier (e.g., Logistic Regression via scikit-learn).

2.Training & Saving: Load dataset, train the model, and save both model and scaler using pickle or joblib.

3.FastAPI App: Create a FastAPI app with Pydantic models to validate input (features like sepal/petal measurements).

4.Model Loading: Load the trained model and scaler at app startup to reuse during predictions.

5.API Endpoints: Create endpoints like / for health check and /predict (POST) to return predictions from the model.

6.Request/Response: Accept JSON input, apply scaling, and return model predictions in a JSON response.

7.Error Handling: Use FastAPIâ€™s built-in validation to handle bad inputs and return clear error messages.

8.Math Behind Model: For Logistic Regression, use sigmoid function to estimate class probabilities from linear combinations.

9.Deployment: Containerize the app using Docker and deploy to cloud (e.g., Render, AWS ECS, or Azure App Service).

10.Scaling & Monitoring: Use Kubernetes or managed services to auto-scale and monitor health, latency, and traffic.
